# Machine Learning for Health
*Basic Science Research Track*, 
*Clinical Research Training Program*  
*Duke University School of Medicine*  

**Course Director:** Matthew Engelhard

**This site is intended to accompany the main course site in [Talent LMS](https://bsrt-dukebiostat.talentlms.com/)**

## Course Materials

- **[Please review the syllabus by clicking here](https://github.com/mengelhard/bsrt_ml4h/blob/master/syllabus.md)**
- Materials for each week are linked in the *Schedule* below

### Readings and Post-Reading Surveys
- A weekly reading + survey will be due before each class (with exceptions noted in the *Schedule*)
- Readings are linked below, and surveys must be completed in [Talent LMS](https://bsrt-dukebiostat.talentlms.com/)
- Both are pass/fail and together are a substantial portion (20%) of your final grade

### Computational Exercises
- Weekly computational exercises will be due before class (again with a few exceptions, as noted in the *Schedule*)
- Each exercise will present code and output, then ask you to modify the code to complete additional tasks
- ***These exercises require you to code in Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment***
- We recommend either [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) or working in [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com).
- Recommended Python resources include [Duke Library tutorials](https://library.duke.edu/data/tutorials), [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes-ebook/dp/B07J4521M3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=Python+book&qid=1618331896&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSVNYTDhDUExZQktDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODgwNjQwM0RNT0U2Nk9XTDdDQiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTg4NjEyODc5U0ZROVNEQkZEJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==), and [Google Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

### Final Project
- The course will culminate in a project in which you apply data science methods to a clinical dataset of your choosing.
- Project instructions and grading details are [here](https://github.com/mengelhard/bsrt_ml4h/blob/master/final_project.md).
- **Proposals are due** before class in week 5, and the **project is due** before the final class period.

## Schedule

- Note that assignments for a given week are **due before class the following week**.
