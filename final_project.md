# Machine Learning for Health Final Project
*due before the last day of class*

## Team Assignment: 
Propose a data science research project related to a clinical topic of your choosing. Your project should use techniques from at least one of the topics discussed in class (e.g. multilayer perceptron, computer vision, natural language processing, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning).

## Background and Significance (1 page): 
Describe the clinical problem, its importance, and the need for the data science approach you are proposing. This should include a brief literature review identifying prior statistical models, if they exist. What recent innovations or developments have made this approach possible? These might relate to new data resources, new data science techniques, or new clinical insights.

## Objective(s) (<.5 pages):
Briefly describe the objectives of your project. If you are developing a predictive model, this should include the type of model, its inputs and outputs, performance metrics, and a hypothesis (or hypotheses) to be evaluated.

## Approach (2-3 pages):
Describe the steps that would be taken to carry out your project, including the following:
- Data acquisition. Your project can use an existing data source or propose a new data collection. If you propose a new study, please describe its design as briefly as possible and focus on the resulting data.
- Data preprocessing. Describe any initial processing that would be conducted prior to modeling.
- Model development. Describe your proposed model and outline steps required to develop it. If you will be using or modifying a previously-developed architecture, please cite it.
- Model training and evaluation. Provide a training and evaluation plan based on (a) cross-validation or (b) a fixed data partition, as appropriate. Justify your choice. If a tuning set is needed, describe how it will be used. List all performance metrics and describe how your hypothesis(-es) will be evaluated.

## Presentation (15 minutes):
Each group will give a 15-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of Q&A on the last day of class. The presentation should include approximately 5 minutes of background, a brief description of objectives, and approximately 10 minutes describing the approach, with emphasis on model development and evaluation. 

## Grading:

Standards | Exemplary (8-10) | Satisfactory (4-7) | Unacceptable (0-3) | Weight
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Motivation | The clinical motivation is compelling and the project is timely and/or novel. | The clinical motivation is present, but portions may be unclear or inadequately researched. | The clinical motivation is underdeveloped and the contribution of the project is questionable. | x2
Goals | Objectives are stated precisely and well-aligned to the clinical problem. | Objectives are aligned to the problem, but some elements are not adequately described. | Objectives do not follow from the background; no clear way to evaluate success/failure. | x1
Data Collection and Preprocessing | Relevant data sources have been obtained and preprocessing is appropriate. | The data have been obtained but preprocessing is inadequate or inappropriate. | Data were not obtained or were irrelevant to the proposed project. | x1
Model Development | The proposed model draws on appropriate data science techniques and was trained successfully. | The proposed model uses older or suboptimal methods, and/or the training process is incomplete or inadequate. | The model is not matched to the data and/or project objectives or was not trained appropriately. | x1
Model Evaluation | Performance metrics align with objectives and are clearly presented. | Some relevant or important metrics have not been included. | Metrics are not appropriate for the problem or not implemented correctly. | x1
Presentation | The project rationale and approach are precisely described with appropriate use of visuals to enhance. | The project rationale and approach are described, but some details are not clear. | The project rationale is not clear and/or the approach is not adequately described. | x3
Response to Questions | Demonstrates full knowledge of topic; explains and elaborates on all questions. | Shows ease in answering questions but does not elaborate. | Answers are unclear or underdeveloped; may not understand the questions. | x1
