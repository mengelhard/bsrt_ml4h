# Machine Learning for Health Final Project
*proposal due in week 6; report and code due before the last day of class*

## Individual *or* Team Assignment: 
**<u>Assignment</u>:** **Develop and evaluate a predictive model** related to a clinical or healthcare topic of your choosing using an existing, publicly available dataset. Your project should use techniques from at least one of the topics discussed in class (e.g. multilayer perceptron, computer vision, natural language processing, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning). Your project will include three deliverables, described below.

## Proposal
*due before class on week 6*

Please turn in a **very brief document** with **one-sentence** descriptions of each of the following:

a. the data source
b. the predictors
c. the outcome
d. the general approach to be used (e.g., CNN)
e. the clinical or healthcare setting in which the model would be used/applied (e.g. ICU)

The proposal will be **5%** of your final grade.

## Code
*due before the last day of class*

Please turn in all code you wrote to develop and evaluate your model. Jupyter notebook format is preferred, but any format (e.g. .py) is acceptable. If your code is in a hosted repository (e.g. Github, Gitlab), a link to the repository is sufficient.

Your code **will not be graded directly**, but will complement your report and allow your work to be verified and/or replicated.

## Report
*due before the last day of class*

Please turn in a 2-3 page document (single-spaced, 11-point, wide margins) with the following sections:

a. **Clinical Setting** (~.5 pages). Describe the clinical setting and the potential benefit of your model in this setting. This should include a very brief (2-5 references) literature review that includes prior statistical models, if they exist.

b. **Model Development** (~1 page). Briefly describe all of the steps required to develop your model, including each of the following:
   - data source and description
   - data preprocessing
   - model type and/or architecture
   - training procedure, including possible use of a validation set
   - evaluation procedure and metrics

c. **Results/Performance** (~1 page). Briefly describe the performance of your final model using tables and/or figures as appropriate. 

- **<u>Important</u>:** your grade depends on your presentation of the results, not the quality/strength of the results per se.

d. **Recommendation** (1 paragraph). Summarize your findings by describing whether, how, and why you believe your model could be useful in a clinical or healthcare setting.

The report will be **25%** of your final grade.

## Grading:

Standards | Exemplary (8-10) | Satisfactory (4-7) | Unacceptable (0-3) | Weight
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Setting | The clinical motivation is compelling and the project is timely and/or novel. | The clinical motivation is present, but portions are not adequately described. | The clinical motivation is unclear and the value of the model is questionable. | x2
Data Source | Relevant data have been obtained and preprocessing is appropriate. | The data have been obtained but preprocessing is inadequate or inappropriate. | Data were not obtained or were irrelevant to the proposed clinical setting. | x1
Model Development | The proposed model draws on appropriate data science techniques and was trained successfully. | The proposed model uses suboptimal methods, and/or the training process is incomplete or inadequate. | The model is not matched to the data and/or project objectives or was not trained appropriately. | x2 
Model Evaluation | Performance metrics align with objectives and are correctly described. | Some relevant or important metrics have not been included. | Metrics are not appropriate for the problem or not implemented correctly. | x1 
Results | Metrics are presented clearly and with appropriate use of visualizations. | Metrics are given, but the presentation is unclear or misinterpreted | Results do not appear to be accurate, or are incomplete | x3
Recommendation | The recommendation is clearly described and aligned with the results. | Aspects of the recommendation are vague or incomplete. | The recommendation is inappropriate given the results presented. | x1
