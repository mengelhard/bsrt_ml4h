[Course Website](https://github.com/mengelhard/bsrt_ml4h)

**Course Director:** Matthew Engelhard
## Bio of Course Director
Matthew Engelhard is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics in the Duke University School of Medicine. He is also the School of Medicine lead for the Duke University-wide +DS (+DataScience) program. Dr. Engelhard’s research focuses on the development of new machine learning methods for risk prediction in clinical medicine and mental health. He received his MD and PhD in Systems and Information Engineering from the University of Virginia, and his BSE in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics from Duke University.

## Course Objective
To provide students with an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of healthcare data science sufficient to (a) design and manage their own research projects in this area, (b) collaborate and communicate effectively with data scientists and data science researchers, and (c) critically evaluate data science methodology, with an emphasis on model validation. Students will be exposed to the material through lectures, hands-on group exercises, readings from the scientific literature, and a final project in data science research design.

## Course Overview
Data science and machine learning (ML) are now beginning to impact clinical medicine, with performance on some tasks, such as detection of skin cancer, exceeding that of experienced clinicians. This course is designed to introduce students to the data science techniques poised to disrupt clinical practice through foundational material and clinical case studies. Course content will provide students with an intuitive, applications-oriented foundation in these techniques while highlighting both their capabilities and current limitations. Students will be introduced to pitfalls commonly encountered when developing models for clinical data as well as relevant practical and ethical considerations.

The course will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to predictive models and the multilayer perceptron
- Convolutional neural networks for medical image analysis
- Natural language processing for patient notes and other text data
- Methods and models for clinical time-series, with applications to EHR predictive modeling
- Reinforcement learning for sequential clinical decision-making

Additionally, the following themes will be emphasized throughout the course:

- Predictive modeling basics: What are they, how have they been (or could they be) incorporated in clinical practice, and what data are required to develop them?
- Predictive models as diagnostic tools: How do they differ from other diagnostics, and how is performance measured?
- Model development and validation: How should models be evaluated, and what might cause them to perform well in one hospital/setting and not in another?
- Ethical issues in ML: What can be done to protect patients’ data/confidentiality and avoid perpetuating bias and health disparities?

The course will culminate in a final design project. Students will work in their teams to propose a project that uses techniques from one of the data science topics listed above, and is related to a clinical or healthcare problem of their interest. The project will have oral and written components, and will focus on clinical/health significance as well as the technical approach.

## Course Readings

## Class Participation and Attendance Policy (per CRTP program)
Attendance in scheduled classes is a requirement for all individuals enrolled in the program. While we recognize the clinical and research responsibilities faced by many of our students, the importance of class attendance and participation is essential to learning, both to the individual student and the class as a whole. 

Students are expected to attend classes regularly and complete assigned coursework in a timely fashion in accordance with the expectations of their instructors. CRTP course directors will clearly communicate course specific attendance policies and expectations in their course syllabi. If these policies are not clear, it is the responsibility of the student to ask the course director for clarification.

Students are expected to notify and negotiate excused absences from course activities with the course director in situations such as illness or health care appointments, attendance at scientific or professional meetings, personal or family emergency, or major life events. Course directors are responsible for making clear to students which portions of their courses require attendance and any limit on excused absences without negative consequence. These absences should be negotiated in writing (email or letter) as far in advance as possible and a plan established for completion of any activity or work missed. Absences announced on short notice due to illness or emergency may still be excused with proper notification of the course director and unannounced absences may be excused in cases of incapacitation to the point of inability to make these contacts.

Any absence without prior notification of the course director is considered unexcused unless documentation of inability to make those contacts is provided. Any absence not approved by a course director for a required part of a course is considered unexcused. An unexcused absence may have a negative impact on the student’s grade or evaluation if so specified in the course syllabus.

Students are strongly encouraged to consult their schedules for the academic term and discuss any planned absences (particularly if multiple class sessions will be missed during the term), with their course director during the drop/add period to determine (a) whether accommodation is possible and (b) arrangements for completing assignments for absences. It is the responsibility of the course director to determine the arrangements (e.g., early submission of work, an alternative assignment, rescheduling an exam, etc.) to be followed when an absence is excused. If accommodation cannot be made, the student may consider whether to remain in the course or drop it in favor of another course that might more easily accommodate their schedule.

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement
The Clinical Research Training Program is designed to produce the next generation of leaders in clinical research grounded in sound ethical and scientific principles. Central among these are principles of diversity and inclusion, which will enhance our students' ability to improve human health effectively and equitably. We affirm principles of diversity and inclusion put forth by the Duke University School of Medicine and Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and we are committed to proactively fostering an inclusive environment in which diverse perspectives and backgrounds are welcome and thrive. Diverse perspectives and backgrounds are particularly critical in machine learning to ensure that decision-making algorithms are used ethically, free from bias, and reduce rather than promote disparities and inequities. We are always looking for ways to make course content more inclusive, and encourage students with recommendations or concerns related to diversity and inclusion in the course content to contact the course director.

## Honor Code
Please review the Code of Professional Conduct for the Duke University School of Medicine [here](https://medschool.duke.edu/education/student-services/office-student-affairs/code-professional-conduct)

**Code of Professional Conduct of the School of Medicine Preamble**

"The Duke University School of Medicine strives to educate health professional students who have a high capacity for ethical professional behavior. Since training in professional behavior is a part of training in the health professions enrolled students commit themselves to comply with all regulations regarding conduct established by Duke University (the Community Standard and the Bulletin of Information and Regulations of Duke University), the School of Medicine and the individualʹs own academic program, as well as the Social Media Policy of the Duke University Health System (link). Professionalism is an academic issue and failure to demonstrate prescribed professional standards may jeopardize advancement and graduation in the same way as other academic matters. These standards closely follow those established and expected for the medical profession for which the student is training and are intended to serve as a precursor to future professional expectations."
