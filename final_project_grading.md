*Due August 7, 2020 at 11:59pm*

Standards | Exemplary (8-10) | Satisfactory (4-7) | Unacceptable (0-3) | Weight
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Background | The clinical motivation is compelling and the project is timely and/or novel. | The clinical motivation is present, but portions may be unclear or inadequately researched. | The clinical motivation is underdeveloped and the contribution of the project is questionable. | x2
Objectives | Objectives are stated precisely and well-aligned to the clinical problem. | Objectives are aligned to the problem, but some elements are not adequately described. | Objectives do not follow from the background; no clear way to evaluate success/failure. | x1
Data Collection and Preprocessing | Data sources have been adequately researched; or the proposed study is feasible. | The data can be obtained but important details are missing. | Acquiring the necessary data is infeasible. | x1
Model Development | The proposed model draws on appropriate, current data science techniques and the development process is clearly outlined. | The proposed model uses older or suboptimal methods, and/or the path to development has not been adequately described. | The proposed model is not matched to the data and/or project objectives. | x1
Model Evaluation | Performance metrics are clearly described; evaluation plan is justified and aligns with objectives. | Some relevant statistical considerations have not been adequately discussed; some mismatch between objectives and evaluation. | Evaluation plan reflects poor understanding of relevant principles, or important details are missing. | x1
Presentation | The project rationale and approach are precisely described with appropriate use of visuals to enhance. | The project rationale and approach are described, but some details are not clear. | The project rationale is not clear and/or the approach is not adequately described. | x3
Response to Questions | Demonstrates full knowledge of topic; explains and elaborates on all questions. | Shows ease in answering questions but does not elaborate. | Answers are unclear or underdeveloped; may not understand the questions. | x1
